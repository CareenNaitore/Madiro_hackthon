# Participants: 
1. Prscovia Nakabuusu 
2. Careen Naitore


This app was based on the need to come up with a better technology to assist collect data from regions. 
where manutrition is a huge problem and lack of technology is a hindrance. 

The app was generated using to three programmes:

1. HTML- Hypertext markup language 
2. PHP- Hypertext Preprocessor 
3. SQL- Structured language 

proscovia come up with an idea for collecting data using a platform that could inform health workers on best practices of conducting a manutrtion study. 
we generated a html form that can collect data from diffferent household and store the on an sql database.
The Application also informs the health work on crictical case and how to handle them.

Although the form can generate data, we have future prospectives for programme: 

1. Generating the form on an offline platform 
2. Generating statistics to inform researchers and the health workers.

**required database for the application**
 
Database: 

1. PHP language processor to convert the html file in the sql datase format.
2. MySQL: contains the fields from our forms
